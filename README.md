### Featured Projects  
- [AC Admisión & Nivelación](https://github.com/Dass-19/AC-Admision_Nivelacion) — We developed a conversational agent based on natural language processing techniques that answers the most frequently asked questions from admission and placement students at the University of Guayaquil.

- [Cancer Risk Prediction System](https://github.com/fundestpuente/HACKATON-Modelo-para-la-Prediccion-del-Riesgo-de-Cancer-a-partir-de-Datos-Clinicos-y-Conductuales) — Intelligent platform based on Machine Learning that predicts cancer risk using clinical and behavioral data, implementing organ-specific models and a generative AI conversational assistant to interpret results and support early detection.

- [Student Dropout Prediction System](https://github.com/Dass-19/desercionEstudiantil) — Machine Learning system that predicts student dropout risk using academic performance and attendance data. Built following the CRISP-DM methodology with an interactive Streamlit app for analysis and model interpretability. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for real-time exploration.
